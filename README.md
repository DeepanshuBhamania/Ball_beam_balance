The core components of the system consist of a horizontal beam, a small ball, actuators, and sensors. The beam serves as the track on which the ball moves, with the ball itself positioned on the beam. Actuators, specifically servo gears, are employed to manipulate the beam's angle, thereby influencing the ball's location. To gauge the ball's position on the beam, ultrasonic distance sensors are used.

**Control Objective**
The primary objective is to maintain the ball's position on the beam at a predetermined location. This is accomplished by dynamically adjusting the beam's angle through a feedback control mechanism.

**Control Process**
Measurement: Sensors continually monitor the ball's current position.
Comparison: The measured position is compared with the desired position.
Control Action: An advanced control algorithm computes the necessary change to the beam's angle based on the positional disparity.
Actuation: Actuators respond by modifying the beam's angle according to the calculated control action.
Feedback Loop: The process is iterative, with the control algorithm fine-tuning the beam's angle according to position feedback.

**Control Strategies**
The utilized control strategy is the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control, a widely employed feedback mechanism. It refines control action by considering the proportional, integral, and derivative components of the error signal. Additionally, to counteract sensor noise, an Exponential filter is applied for precise position measurement.

**Challenges and Considerations**
Stability: A vital challenge is to ensure the ball's stable position without causing oscillations.
Nonlinearities: The ball and beam setup demonstrates nonlinear tendencies due to factors like friction and inertia.
Sensor Noise: The presence of real-world sensor noise can distort position measurements, necessitating noise mitigation techniques.
Actuator Constraints: The actuators may have limitations on their operational range and speed.

**Technology Utilized**
The system is powered by Arduino technology, which integrates the various components and facilitates the execution of control algorithms for the seamless operation of the ball and beam setup.
